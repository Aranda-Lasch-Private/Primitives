Primitives is a generative art project launched through [Art Blocks Curated](https://www.artblocks.io/legacy/collections/curated/projects/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/368) in October, 2022

[Primitives](https://arandalasch.com/project/primitives/) is a project about growth through a novel geometric block. This block is a simple shape that can repeat and scale in specific ways that are never random, but tightly controlled through geometric logics. While its appearance as an engraving seems two dimensional, by rotating the Primitives its three-dimensional form is revealed. Download the object file and explore outputting it as a 3D print or any other fabrication method.

Two sources from the worlds of science and art inspired the project’s outcome: Albrecht Dürer’s Engravings and phenomena of Quasicrystals. Together, they create an anachronistic project about drawing infinity through a radical modularity.

The feature set probes the unique properties of the Primitives crystalline growth, their fractal depth and lattices. We also looked closely at the process of engraving to inform the variability in representation, from different inked backgrounds to paper colors. There are even incomplete and fragmented drawings which were inspired from Durer’s sketches. Overall the feature set is rigorously designed to balance variety and uniqueness with conceptual aims
